The assignment goal was to create a visual to track time. The code I was trying to implement was different hues of ellipses along the y axis with every passing second. The ellipses will start a new line with every new minute, and subsequently the canvas would clear up with every passing hour. 
I started of by creating a variable to record the last second, and compare it to the current second, so that with every second, the y axis increments, and a new ellipse would be created. I also used the random() feature to change the color of every ellipse. 
I then used the same logic to record the last minute and current minute, so that when the two variables did not match, the x axis would increment, starting a new line of ellipses. 
Lastly, I did the same for hours, where the canvas would be cleared. 
This assignment was quite difficult for me, as I was struggling to understand the concept of time passing as per the computer. However, I used the print() feature to see how the seconds, minutes, and hours progress to better understand the concept.

For the firts attempt, I played around with the functions we used in class. I simply tried to play around with the shapes, colors, and orientations. I used a lot of the random() tool in order to get different patterns. 
Next, I experimented with the other tools such as doubleClicked(). 
I created the different functions, and then tried running it. 
This assignment was quite fun, as I got to experiment a lot with color and shapes, to create something visually interesting. The functions were quite straightforward to create.
